# Small S.O.L.I.D project


## The Goal: Name Sorter

Build a name sorter. Given a set of names, order that set first by last name, then by any given names the person may have. A name must have at least 1 given name and may have up to 3 given names.

## SOLID criteria.

The names should be sorted correctly.
It should print the sorted list of names to screen.
It should write/overwrite the sorted list of names to a file called sorted-names-list.txt. Unit tests should exist.
Minimal, practical documentation should exist.

## Installation

- "npm install"

## Running application

Project can be run with `node index.js unsorted-names-list.txt` directly.

## Running tests

Shortcuts :

- `npm test` to run all tests once
