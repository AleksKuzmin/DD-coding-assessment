Dye & Durham Coding Assessment

## The Goal: Name Sorter

Build a name sorter. Given a set of names, order that set first by last name, then by any given names the person may have. A name must have at least 1 given name and may have up to 3 given names.

## My submission must meet the following criteria.

The solution should be available for review on github.
The names should be sorted correctly.
It should print the sorted list of names to screen.
It should write/overwrite the sorted list of names to a file called sorted-names-list.txt. Unit tests should exist.
Minimal, practical documentation should exist.

## Installation

- "npm install"

## Running application

Project can be run with `node index.js unsorted-names-list.txt` directly.

## Running tests

Shortcuts :

- `npm test` to run all tests once
